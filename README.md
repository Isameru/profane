:construction: Performance tracer for C++11

Currently just a Proof of Concept developed as a Visual Studio project.
The first run of Profane Analyser dumps the performance log binary data to perflog.bin.
The second run reads that file and presents it in a form of a flame graph.
The project contains Windows x64 runtime binaries of SDL2 library.
